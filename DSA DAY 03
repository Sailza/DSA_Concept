Priori Analysis
1) Done on algorithm 
2) It is Independent of language 
3) hardware independent 
4) We can analyse time and space complexity 

Posteriori Testing
1) Done on Program or actual code written 
2) It is language dependent 
3) It is hardware dependent 


Characteristics of an algorithm 
1) Input - Algorithm can take 0 oer more input 
2) output - Algorithm must generate atleast one output
3) Definiteness - Every statement in an algorithm shoul contain Clear meaning 
4) Finiteness - Algorithm should contain finite no of steps , you have to stop after some lines 
5) Effectiveness - Dont write un necessary steps in an algorithm , every step written in an algorithm should have some purpose to write
