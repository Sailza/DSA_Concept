Algorithm is an step by step procedure to solve  a computational program 
difference between Algorithm and program are:
1) In sdlc model there are two imp step designing and implemention phase, in design phase we usuallyu write an algorithm 
and after design we implement the designing into proper code is called Program
we cannot evertime write the whole code so we can first write the algorithm for particular task

2) For writing algorithm we canuse english lang, mathematical notation but
in programming we have to write particular coding language like C,Cpp , java , python  etc.

3)Algorithm doesnt depend on hardware or software but 
while writing code  we have to choose particular harware and software supported by our Programming language

4) After writing Algorithm we can analyse the code and check whether we get desired output or not 
but after writing program we can test the test cases to check it meet user requirement or not
